# Blood Donation Predictions

This repo contains files for a machine learning project. The data set used is the UCI Machine Learning Repository [Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center), which contains information on a list of blood donors including time since last donation and number of donations, and a binary variable indicating whether they donated blood in March 2007. 

The goal of this sproject is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a person donated blood in March 2007 based on the other information available.

### Files

- project_notebook.ipynb: The jupyter notebook containing the code used to build and train the model
- transfusion.data: The data used to train and test the model
- KNN_Blood_Donations.joblib: The final model
